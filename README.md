# Rebark
Mod that allows you to add bark back to logs, forge version.

## Datapacks
Use the `rebark:(whitelist|blacklist)_(rebark|strip)` (heh bad regex notation) to enable/disable things. An action is considered enabled if it is in the whitelist and not in the blacklist. If whitelist is not used, then all things are considered whitelisted.
